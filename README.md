# Health-Insurance-Fraud-Detection
Although the healthcare sector is intricate and expanding quickly, it also has to deal with an increase in fraud. Hospitalization costs before and after surgery are only one of the numerous advantages of having health insurance. Any health insurance transaction involves significant financial outlays. As a result, fraud is particularly common in this sector. Health insurance fraud can be characterized as a circumstance in which an insured or medical care provider provides fraudulent, inaccurate, or misleading information to an insurer with the goal of obtaining disproportionate profits from a policy for the policyholder or provider. Massive sums of money can be recovered with the timely discovery and prevention of health insurance fraud. In this study, we investigate healthcare fraud and the approaches used to identify it using machine learning algorithms. On the basis of a study of the majority of claims, the data establishes the normal pattern of behavior for providers of various specializations who treat a variety of ailments and identifies aberrant patterns. By pooling all observed abnormalities, the solution finds providers whose behavior exhibits systematic deviations. This aims to cover the many fraud schemes that exist in the healthcare industry as well as the methods used to catch them. In order to address the issue of bogus health insurance claims, the suggested solution leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and discover significant sources and characteristics within healthcare data.
